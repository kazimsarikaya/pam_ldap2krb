This package provides a pam module for ldap system to ldap+kerberos 
(with ldap backend).

The name of pam module is pam_ldap2krb.

Module has an configuration file at /etc/pam_ldap2krb.conf

The main and only aim of the module is, migration of user passwords to
the kerberos. The ldap's userpassword format and kerberos's 
krbprincipalkey data formats are different. While migration the user
passwords need resets. However this progress is annoying for users.
Hence this module helps for migration. 

For building: run ./autogen.sh and then regular ./configure
If you want to build only rpm packages only run: make rpmbuild 
However you can continue with make and make install.

For installing
The module assumes that you have an ldap id provider, and a kerberos
installation with ldap backend at the same ldap sever.
You should install sssd with id provider ldap and chpass & auth
provider kerberos. The pam module for sssd should be set and working.

Then process with these steps:

Create a kerberos user and set a password. Add change password acl for
this user.

Add to system-auth and password-auth before pam_sssd.so module:

auth    requisite    pam_ldap2krb.so /etc/pam_ldap2krb.conf

Modify /etc/pam_ldap2krb.conf 

In configuration file you can see sample settings. ldap base, ldap
search dn and password, kerberos ldap base, a kerberos change password
user and its authentication token and kerberos realm.

For migration of passwords is:

Searching user on ldap and authenticate it. Then looking for if
kerberos principal key is set or not. If it is not set, the password
user entered is saved to the kerberos. Otherwise kerberos password does
not change.

After migration completed, you can remove pam settings.

For migration process the login may be slow because of setting kerberos
passwords.

For any question you can contact me.
